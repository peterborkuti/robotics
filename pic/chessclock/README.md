# Chessclock in C for PIC16x PIC16F684

## A project from 2012

## Forewords

It was my first C project. In the past I used assembly to programming PIC, but
it was too slow, so I decided to switch to C. Here is the outcome.
I decided to post it to a Hungarian forum, so I documented it in Hungarian.
