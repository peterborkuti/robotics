I'd like to build a simple two wheeled balancing "robot" without giro/accelerometer:

* 2 wheels in a common shaft
* 1 motor (maybe continuous rotational servo or a geared DC motor with a motor driver)
* two gears (on a servo + on a shaft)
* 1 HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
* 1 arduino nano
* powerbank/battery pack
* PID control
* appropriate case for the robot

I have all the necessary parts (apart from the "gears" and I have an idea of the "case")

Goal: knowing how to tune (=find the appropriate constants) a PID control algorithm and having a cool robot
